Observation: Word embedding done in a hyperbolic map results in better
classified tree like structure of word vector.

Hypothesis: The heirarchical ranking of the embedding will result in better
machine learning task like bilingual lexicon induction, wsd.

Prediction: After converting the word vector in the hyperbolic plane, the
precision@1 of bilingual lexicon induction for both source and target language
will increase as compared to normal proceteus solution.

Experiment:we will convert to the source and target word to word vector and then
plot the vector in a hyperbolic plane. We will try to transform source to target
vector by couple of linear transformation and which we will find by decreasing
the cosine distance between source and target languages. We will run a gradient
descent in the same setting as previous for proceteus solution.

a) Outcome of the experiment that validates the hypothesis: The
precision@1 of bilingual lexicon induction for both source and target language
will increase as compared to normal proceteus solution.

b)Outcome of the experiment that invalidates the hypothesis: The
precision@1 of bilingual lexicon induction for both source and target language
will increase as compared to normal proceteus solution.
